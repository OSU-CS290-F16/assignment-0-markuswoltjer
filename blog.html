<h3>Blog Entree: Assignment 0</h3>
<h5>Monday, September 26th, 2016</h5>
<p>For the sake of me not droning on in a paragraph, I will try to answer the prompt questions succinctly and then if there's extra stuff that I never got to say I might add another question or two--still focus is trying to stay on topic. :)</p>
<ul><li>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them?
	<ul><li>The main challenge I had was just getting the structure and purpose of github. I tried using the recommended tutorial but I felt like it was not conveying the basic purpose and what was happening and the exact instructions of what to type made it worse trying to learn it. I still might go back and try watching some youtube tutorials from a third party. I'm used to websites where you upload and download files, and I guess that's what's happening in essence, but the extra integration with the git tool in command line and the file explorer is a little bit of a learning curve to start.</li></ul>
			</li>
			<li>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?
			<ul>
<li>I figured out all that github purpose and structure stuff from an explanation that I think came off Piazza. "Per Hampus Hammerlund" posted some "slides" showing how to add, commit, and push, and it made sense, at least for the scope of this assignment. I think I want to play around with the branches more for further understanding in the next few days. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?
<ul><li> Again, Per Hampus Hammerlund's notes were a really straightforward way for me to get essentially just the significance of adding, committing, and pushing. After learning that, I began recalling things from the try git tutorial and just playing around with my files. After having that intuition, it was reinforced by covering the same topics in lecture today (Monday). I still have some questions of branching and how git/github would manifest itself in group projects, which I intend to pursue via independent resources (I like video lectures so YouTube will be my first stop).</li></ul></li>
